# Sticky Notes App

A simple React-based sticky notes application that allows users to create, edit, and organize colorful notes on a virtual board.

## Features

- ✅ Create multiple sticky notes with a single click
- 🖱️ Drag and drop notes to position them anywhere on the board
- ✏️ Edit note content directly
- 🎨 Each note gets a random pastel color from a predefined palette
- 💾 Persistent notes (though currently only in-memory - refreshes will clear them)
